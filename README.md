# Ibernia Engineering Assessment

This exercise is designed to evaluate how you deliver a production-oriented feature end to end.

You are expected to use AI-assisted engineering tools. We care about how you reason, validate, test, and ship—not whether you write every line manually.

## Scenario

Ibernia is building tools for financial advisers. Advisers often write free-form notes after speaking with a client. We want to turn those notes into structured information that can be reviewed by an adviser.

Your task is to implement an **Advisor Note Extractor**.

An adviser should be able to paste meeting notes and receive structured output containing information such as:

- goals
- financial facts
- future events
- risks or questions

Example input:

```text
John wants to retire at 62. His current pension is £420,000.
He is worried about whether £55,000 per year is sustainable in retirement.
He may sell his second property in five years.
```

A reasonable output could look like:

```json
{
  "goals": ["Retire at age 62"],
  "financialFacts": {
    "pension": 420000,
    "desiredAnnualSpending": 55000
  },
  "futureEvents": ["Potential property sale in five years"],
  "risksOrQuestions": ["Retirement spending sustainability"]
}
```

The exact schema is yours to design. Explain your decisions.

## Your responsibility

Treat this as a small production feature, not a coding puzzle.

You own the full delivery lifecycle:

1. Understand the requirement.
2. Identify ambiguities and document assumptions.
3. Propose a lightweight technical design.
4. Implement the feature.
5. Add appropriate tests.
6. Open a pull request with a useful description.
7. Configure CI so the relevant checks run automatically.
8. Deploy the application.
9. Verify the deployed feature works.
10. Document anything you would improve before a real production release.

## AI/tool usage

**AI-assisted development is expected and encouraged.**

You may use Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, documentation, search, MCP tools, or other tools you would normally use.

Create an `AI_WORKLOG.md` containing a concise record of:

- tools used
- important prompts or instructions
- notable AI-generated suggestions you accepted
- notable AI-generated suggestions you rejected or changed
- bugs or problems discovered through review/testing

Do not paste every interaction. We want to understand how you directed and validated the tools.

## Functional expectations

At minimum:

- A user can submit adviser/client meeting notes.
- The backend processes the notes using an LLM or AI provider.
- The response is structured and validated before being returned to the caller.
- Missing information must remain missing; the application must not invent financial facts.
- AI/provider failures must be handled safely.
- Invalid model responses must not crash the application.
- The user receives understandable feedback when processing fails.

## Security expectations

Assume the submitted notes may contain sensitive personal and financial information.

You should consider:

- secrets management
- logging
- accidental exposure of note contents
- prompt injection / untrusted note content
- input validation
- authorization boundaries, even if authentication itself is out of scope

## Testing expectations

Choose the test coverage you believe is appropriate. We expect more than a happy-path test.

Consider scenarios such as:

- valid structured extraction
- incomplete notes
- approximate or ambiguous values
- malformed AI output
- AI timeout/provider error
- malicious or instruction-like text inside the notes

## Deployment

Deploy the solution to a publicly reachable test environment. Railway is preferred, but another reasonable platform is acceptable.

Secrets must not be committed to GitHub.

## Deliverables

Submit:

- GitHub pull request
- deployed URL
- `docs/DESIGN.md`
- `AI_WORKLOG.md`
- automated tests
- short PR summary covering:
  - what you built
  - key decisions
  - how you tested it
  - deployment details
  - known limitations

## Timebox

Target **3–4 hours** of focused work.

If you cannot finish everything, submit what you have. Explain what remains and what you would do next. A well-reasoned partial solution is more useful than hidden unfinished work.

## Starting the repository

The starter contains:

- `.NET 9` API
- a small React/Vite frontend shell
- test project
- GitHub Actions starter workflow
- Docker support

You may change the structure if you can justify the change.

### Backend

```bash
cd apps/api
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

Good luck. We are interested in how you work as much as the final code.
